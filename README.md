# Peyton-Castillo-Portfolio
This is Peyton Castillo's portfolio website (built by Peyton Castillo) with a list of skills useful to potential employers!
Please note that the portfolio links go to my github account. When I get more live websites I'll replace the place holders with more helpful photos and better links.
